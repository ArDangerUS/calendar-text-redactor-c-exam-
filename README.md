# Project Title

## Overview

This project implements various classes and functionalities related to date and time management, event scheduling, calendar operations, text display, dictionary building, and deque operations. The project is divided into several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of the overall functionality.

### Tasks

1. **Date and Time Classes**
   - Validation
   - Getters and setters
   - Determining the day of the week
   - Increment and decrement operations
   - Arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `+=`, `-=`)
   - Comparison operators
   - Output utilities

2. **Event Class**
   - Date
   - Time
   - Type
   - Priority
   - Title
   - Description

3. **Calendar Class**
   - Display a specific month or year
   - Navigate between months
   - Highlight current and important dates
   - Integrate with `Event` class
   - Filter events by type, priority, month, or specific period

4. **Semester End Date Calculation**
   - Calculate the end date of a semester given its duration in weeks and the start date

5. **Day of the Week Calculation**
   - Determine the day of the week for your birthday and birthdays of notable figures in science and culture

6. **Screen Class**
   - Display a fragment of text starting from a specific position
   - Implement scrolling forward and backward
   - Read text from a file using `std::ifstream`

7. **Screen Copying and Moving**
   - Ensure copying and moving of screens
   - Implement text editing within the screen

8. **Dictionary Class**
   - Build a dictionary from text
   - Sort words lexicographically or by frequency
   - Track foreign words with specified statuses (e.g., new, learning, learned, ignored)
   - Implement operations for dictionary addition, union, intersection, and output utilities

9. **Deque Interface Inheritance**
   - Build interface inheritance for bidirectional queues `Deque<T>` using array-based and list-based queues
   - Apply Non-Virtual Interface (NVI) pattern

10. **Deque Implementation Inheritance**
    - Construct implementation inheritance for bidirectional queues `Deque<T, Implementation>` using array-based `ArrayDeque<T>` and list-based `ListDeque<T>`
    - Compare the use of private inheritance and composition (aggregation)
